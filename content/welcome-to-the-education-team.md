### Education Team Roles

At it's highest level the mission of the Education Team is to 

> Create an inclusive learning community that communitises failure, encourages growth through challenge and provides support to those that need it most.

In practically what this means is the course services that we provide to our students

* Community, class based learning once a week - **our lessons on Saturday/Sunday**
* Dedicated support structures during the week - **our Buddy Mentoring system**
* A 24 hour community of fellow learners - **our online community on Slack**

These tasks are broadly separated into roles under taked by different people at different times.

* Lead Teacher
* Teaching Assistant
* Syllabus Team
* Education Buddy
* Education Director

#### Exercise 

Take a look at the Google Sheet below.   
  
In it, you'll find a column of tasks that members of the Education Team undertake and a row of roles at CodeYourFuture.

1. Create a Copy of this Google Sheet
2. Share your screen with your group
3. Copy & Paste each of the tasks in to each column
   1. Each task might fit into more than one column!

When you've finished we'll re-group and discuss.

### Tools

#### Slack

On your journey to becoming a volunteer at CodeYourFuture you will recieve access to our Slack Workspace. This is where all of our communication happens and were are classes take place.

If you haven't already we ask you to

* Set your name as your real name
* Set your display picture as picture of you \(or a cartoon picture of you if you'd prefer\)

In addition to the normal rules of Slack \(e.g. use Threads, don't use @channel, etc \) we operate on a single golden rule

> **Communicate, coordinate and collaborate in public channels**

We're a large and growing organisation where information needs to flow smoothly - it's one of our key challenges. By communicating in direct messages or in private channels it makes it really hard for people to stay up to date why the schools. 



#### Github

We use Github to store and review homework for the students. You'll often find it linked from the Syllabus. 

For now, the most important part is that you are added as a collaborator to our \`Mentors\` Github Team

#### Syllabus
