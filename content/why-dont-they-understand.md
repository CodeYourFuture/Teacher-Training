# Why don't they understand?

## Context

Teachers can have a very strong urge to give students answers - but it's important for students to work out as much as they can by themselves:

* To give them a greater sense of ownership and achievement in their learning
* The more students think about something, [the more likely they are to remember it](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf)

## Trainer notes

### What's the misunderstanding here? \(slide 3\)

This is based on a real interaction I had with a student, who had run into an issue and wanted some help with it.

He was trying to get a delete button to appear after each item on the list, and didn't understand why his code wasn't working.

At this point, I think a good teacher train of thought is: 1. Diagnose the misconception 2. Construct a path for the student to realise the misconception 3. Guide them along the path.

I think this easiest way is to [see this in action](https://www.loom.com/share/f055dc062d494a388d38cb39bbe0902d).

### Reflections \(Slide 8\)

I would typically ask them to spend 1-2 minutes thinking about this, and then invite a couple of trainees to share.
