# The Classroom

## Presentation Slides

{% embed url="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g4zWxj-2Jr3XhLMjDFcIA2G53g8R1jRYb4boBls0\_ic" %}

## Learning Objectives

* For Teachers and TAs to understand the value of teacher training
* To make every education volunteer feel like they have a vital role to play in Code Your Future \(whether as TA or Teacher\)
* For Teachers and TAs to have a joint understanding of what they can reasonably expect of each other

## Science of the Classroom

**Key takeaways**

* We can help students to learn more effectively by considering the science of teaching and learning
* Some results are counter-intuitive
* Providing formative evaluation to teachers is one of the most high impact ways of improving student outcomes

**Exercise**

Individually, take some time to decide whether each of these has _high_, _medium_ or _low_ effects on student achievement.

Discuss in groups and arrive at a group consensus.

* Ability grouping/tracking/streaming
* Concept mapping
* Cooperative instead of individualistic learning
* Direct instruction
* Feedback
* Home environment
* Individualised instruction
* Peer influences
* Matching teaching with student learning styles
* Metacognitive strategy programmes
* Providing formative evaluation to teachers
* Providing worked examples
* Reducing class size
* Student control over learning
* Student expectations
* Teacher credibility in eyes of student
* Teacher expectations
* Teacher subject matter knowledge
* Teacher-student relationships

Tally the responses from each group before comparing to the results.

| Teacher credibility in eyes of the students | x |  |  |
| Teacher expectations |  | x |  |
| Teacher subject matter knowledge |  |  | x |
| Teacher-student relationships | x |  |  |

**Discussion**

Individually, then in groups:

1. What do you find most surprising?
2. What does this mean for us as education volunteers?

## The Learning Journey

### **Key takeaways**

* We are outcome-oriented: getting students into junior developer roles
* To support students to reach those outcomes, we take them through a journey of great change in acquiring knowledge and skills
* Our role is to help build up to those knowledge and skills
* We should think purposefully about the knowledge and skills that we are intending to deliver in a given interaction or period of interactions

### **Activity**

Individually, take some time to think about the knowledge and skills that we might want a student to leave with at the end of the programme.

Discuss your responses in groups.

Feedback to the room and collect common themes on the board.

Repeat for a Module \(JavaScript\) and Lesson \(functions\).

</table>**Discussion**

Individually, and then in groups:

1. Who is this useful to?
2. How is it useful to them?

### Needs and Responsibilities

**Key takeaways**

* The classroom is a complex system with multiple actors \(student, teacher, TA\)
* Any given actor has needs from, and responsibilities to, every other actor
* A lesson is a cooperative enterprise built on mutual respect for these other actors
* It is the interests of everybody - students, Code Your Future and volunteers themselves - for all volunteers to continually develop their teaching skills
* Feedback is a gift that helps people develop those skills, for themselves and others
* Each actor has a unique vantage point from which to give feedback

**Group activity**

Split the room into small groups. Each group is tasked with considering a given role \(‘student’, ‘teacher’, ‘TA’\) and that role’s _needs from_ and _duties to_ the other actors in the classroom.

\(Students have duties to / needs from other students in the class; TAs have duties to / needs from other TAs in the class; teachers have duties to / needs from other teachers in other classes\)

**Discussion**

Have groups feedback to the room. Collect key things in a table, similar to the below:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <p>Y&#x2019;s need from X</p>
        <p><em>Y&#x2019;s duty to X</em>
        </p>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">&#x2026; Student</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">&#x2026; Teacher</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">&#x2026; TA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Student...</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Teacher...</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">TA...</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>#### Reflection

Individually, come up with:

1. The most important thing that you know or understand more about now
2. The biggest unanswered question you have, or what is most unclear to you, or what you would like to learn next
