  Understand the students is important in order to be able to teach them. In
  this session we'll explore how to identify common challenges with students.

# Empathy

## Learning Objectives

* Teachers/TAs can list common challenges faced by CYF students
* Teachers/TAs can identify when to leave a student to work alone

## Student Challenges

#### Exercise

Work in small groups to name common student challenges, report back to group.

#### Discussion

\* TODO: link to process for a teacher to follow with code of conduct violations in class \(minor or severe\). It may come up.

**Behaviour**

The students might have reasons for...

* not doing the homework,
* having difficulty concentrating,
* lack of interest,
* being reticent to speak out in class,
* not wanting to identify themselves online,
* wanting time to themselves,
* being on their phone in class,
* irritability or bursts of anger,
* missing class,
* ... something else that you don't see coming

**Possible challenges**

Here are some possibilities that students may be facing, for you to bear in mind:

\(by no means a comprehensive list\)

* uncertainties about their right to stay in the country
* poor current accommodation
* uncertain upcoming accommodation
* financial difficulties
* lack of employment opportunities
* worries about family members
* language and cultural difficulties
* recently faced extremely stressful events
* kids or other dependants to care for
* no suitable study environment \(e.g. no quiet, no wifi\)
* might not have had a good night's sleep
* an unstable situation which changes from week to week
* Language: English might not be their first, second, or third language. It may also appear fine verbally but weak in reading and writing, or vice versa.
* Culture: Culturally, they might not have been previously encouraged to study, to speak out, or to seek employment in tech.
* Time: The amount of hours each student has available to study may vary wildly. Compare: a young, healthy student with no right to work, no job, and no dependants vs mother of two young kids, with two jobs
* Experience: The level of experience students have had with the material will vary wildly, within a class:
* some may have very limited experience with computer basics
* some may have studied programming at university level \(or even taught related\)
* some may have done a bootcamp before

#### Despite these issues

* we want to challenge each student to reach their potential
* we expect each student to follow the code of conduct

#### Your role in this

TODO: Generate a group exercise to discuss what attendees think is their role in this context.

As a teacher or teaching assistant it's _not_ your responsibility to investigate or resolve suspected student welfare issues.

* Take each student as you find them
* bear these possibilities in the back of your mind during your interactions
* try to have more patience than you might normally
* be sensitive to when your help or attention might _not_ be wanted
* avoid comparing effort and output between students
* celebrate progress where you find it
* treat others as you would yourself be treated
* know who you should speak to when you have concerns
