## Learning Objectives

* For TAs and Teachers to consider the importance of questioning
* Helping students without giving the answer away

## A World with No Questioning

Imagine that Teachers and TAs were _banned_ from asking questions.

In what ways would this negatively impact learning?

Consider individually and then discuss in groups.

What does this tell us about the purposes of questioning?

### Why do we question?

* We taught it != they learned it
* We need to make the invisible \(their learning, inside their heads\) visible
* We should confirm:
  * That they are able to give good answers
  * That they have reliable reasoning processes and mental models to reach those answers

## Questioning as an Educational Tool

Two important findings from cognitive neuroscience:

* Testing effect
* Memory is the residue of thought

Correspondingly, question for:

* Factual recall
* Provoking deep thought
