## Context

This training session is meant to build on the previous session by looking at getting larger-scale engagement.

## Trainer notes

### Partial samples \(slide 2-3\)

The downside of Cold Call / Targeted Questioning is that it only gets answers from a single student at a given time. Whilst other students _may_ be listening, it is also possible that their attention drops off.

### Call and Response \(slide 4\)

Call and Response is a way of generating much larger participation from the class.

It has to be adapted for online, but here's how it might work in person:

> Teacher: "So, what's a `.` a CSS selector for?" Class \(in unison\): "A class!"

It's unorthodox, and might not work the first time you try - but if you persevere \(and even make them re-do it if it didn't work the first time\), classes can quickly get the hang of it.

You can adapt this for online through things like:

* Visual feedback on cameras \(e.g. "what's the CSS id selector? Make a fist for `.`, spread your palm for `#`\)
* Use of Slack / Zoom chat \(e.g. "Write a CSS selector for this `<div class='container' />` and get ready to send it... now"\)

### Everybody Writes \(slide 5\)

Slack / Zoom chat can be a powerful way of getting detailed insights from larger portions of your class, e.g.:

> "Now, I want you to try writing some CSS to style this `div` in a distinctive way - when you're done, please stick it in this Slack thread / the Zoom chat."

### Narrate Contributions \(slide 6\)

If you're doing Call and Response or Everybody Writes, it's important to acknowledge the contributions from students - to communicate that their participation matters.

### Reflections \(Slide 8\)

I would typically ask them to spend 1-2 minutes thinking about this, and then invite a couple of trainees to share.
