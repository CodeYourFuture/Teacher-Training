# Homework Mentor Training

## What is a Homework Mentor?

## Training

### Why do we mentor? \(5 minutes\)

_If the group is smaller than six people_

As a form of icebreaker and a way to get to know each other have everybody introduce themselves and say:

* Their name 
* Where they're from
* What they do
* Why they want to mentor or why they see the importance in mentoring

The aim of this discussion is to explore the reasons that people are volunteering with us. 

_If the group is larger than six people_

Split the group into smaller groups of 3 or 4 people, then complete the above exercise

### What is our commitment to you? \(5 minutes\)

We commit to have students who are engaged, willing to learn, inquisitive, respectful and looking to change their lives through hard work. 

We endeavour to work to the mantra 

> Never teach alone

This means that whilst you may physically be alone with our students we will support you with online support in our Slack channel and teaching material to help our students. If you ever struggle or have problems teaching our students we are here to support you.

Finally, we want to give back to them by providing teaching lessons and a community of people who are committed to real change.
