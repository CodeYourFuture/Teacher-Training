## Lesson

### What is a Mentor?

```text
 Exercise 1 (5 Minutes)
 ​
 In small groups, discuss 
 ​
 - What you think are qualities of a good mentor? 
 - What about the qualities of a programming mentor? 
 - Have you had a good mentor in the past? Why were they good?
```

### Mentoring at CodeYourFuture

At CodeYourFuture, being a mentor means you have a set of core responsibilities

1. Check in with students at least every two weeks and assess understanding
2. Check and mark homework that students are submitting
3. Provide feedback on students to the wider team

As a buddy, you are assigned three students who are your responsibility for. You should try to have calls with them every week or two weeks and check in consistently with them week to week. As a mentor, you are one of the key people who the students can be accountable to - an important role in a course like ours that requires a lot of self study!

### Mentoring Sessions

A part of your job as a buddy is to have calls with your students to assess and work out how they're doing in the course. This can be done either as 1-to-1s or group sessions depending on your time commitments, your 

#### Before The Call

Consider getting [Calend.ly](http://calend.ly) or similar so that students can book in times with you that work for them. This will save a significant amount of time when you are trying to work out a time that works for both of you.

It can be helpful if you take a quick look at the weeks content in the [syllabus](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/) to see what the student has been working on that week.

#### During Calls

At the highest level when you speak to your students you should

1. Be finding out if they have submitted the homework for that week
   1. If they haven't - find out why
2. Find out how challenging they are finding the work
3. Investigating their understanding of the concepts covered

As you become more experienced taking mentoring calls you will develop your own style and pacing to the sessions. 

Some ways for you to access understand are to 

* Ask the student to talk through some of their most recent homework
* Ask the student to add a new small feature to their homework
* Complete a programming challenge \(many of these can be found in the [the syllabus](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/)\)

Throughout the call make notes on the specific areas that your students are not understanding. A useful way for you to describe somebodies understanding is using [Blooms Taxonomy](https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/).

```text
Exercise 2 (10 Minutes)

For each of the following examples decide which part of Blooms Taxonomy they would fall in to. 

A student can possess some of the more advanced skills without having the more basic skills. It is important to pick up on a students mising base!

1. The student can write an if statement but cannot use it to decide what happens when a button is clicked
2. The student has built a React application but without separating their code into separate classes
3. The student can use a forEach and a Map function but they cannot describe how they differ
4. The student can read a challenge statemnet and accurately turn that into a working application
5. The student can write a function but does not know how to call it
6. You ask a student to create a function and they use the wrong syntax
7. You ask a student to create a function and they do not know where to start
```

### Feeding Back To The Team

Depending on your team you will decide to meet every week or two weeks to discuss the progress that the students are making through the module. Especially earlier in the course it is important that you detect and report any student that are falling behind so that they can get the support they need.

In these sessions try to be as succinct as possible. It will be tempting to spend time talking about the students who are doing well but it is important that you give adequate time discussing the problems that the struggling students are having.

In your sessions, try to work out students who are struggling in the same ways or in the same areas. This can be key to finding holes in their education and can be leveraged to make the best use of your time.

### Remedial Tools

If you discover that your student has fallen behind or has struggled to understand some part of the course then you have several tools at your disposal.

* **Organised Study Groups** - Ask your course coordinator or other buddies to see if there are any organised study groups this week. For most students, dedicated time with a mentor can be a great way to catch up with the course
* **Encouraging Team Work** - Overwhelmingly, the greatest source of help that a student can get is from their fellow students. Encourage the student to setup mid-week calls with the rest of the students in their class to get help. If the student is resistant to this idea, consider setting up their first calls with them on a public channel and invite others. 
* Organising a Break Week - If lots of students have not understood some concepts adding a break week can be good way to make sure that students have enough time to

If a student is struggling with time management and dedicating enough time the course you can try these tools

* **Daily Stand-up** - Ask the student to send you a message every morning about their progress over the past day. It's fine for them to say they've done nothing - the aim of this exercise is to build a habit of consistent working - not to shame the student into working every day. 
* **Study Plans** - If a student is struggling to find time to work on their homework a good tactic is to work with them on a Study Plan that accurately plans out their week. \(It can also be useful to work with their Personal Development Mentor on this plan\)

Exercise 3 (10 minutes)

In small groups, let's brainstorm some other ideas of how people can get help if they fall behind.

What techniques have you used in the past?
```

### **Technical Mentoring** 

Hosting a short call with the students for some technical mentoring is a great way to build a relationship with your students. 

You should always try to have these calls in public Slack channels \(if the student is comfortable\) so that multiple students can benefit from your work. It also normalises the idea of having public calls with other students.

When you're working with your student there are a few rules that you should follow

**1. Don't touch the keyboard**

It is vitally important that no matter how great the temptation the student should always be in control of the keyboard. 

**2. You're there to guide - not to tell**

When you are mentoring your role is to help the student get to the solution themselves and not simply complete the 

**3. Use Google**

Developing a students Google skills is an important skill so don't be afraid to ask them to Google to find the answer. The whole problem solving process is important.

**4. Let the student think**

Prolonged silences may feel awkward but giving the student enough time to think and work through a problem is critical. Don't be afraid to step away for a moment or focus on the next task while the student continues to work. 

If the student is taking a long time, try to guide them through questioning - rather than through facts - to reach the solution they are working towards.

**5. Be Logical**

A key skill that you can impart on a student is to be deeply logical and encouraging them to inspect every line of their code. You should be engaged and always ask questions such as “what does that line of code do?”, or “who calls this function?”.

**6. Reject Self-Response**

When offering technical support try not to let yourself fall into the trap of 

> "Right, we've covered map functions, do you think you understand everything we just did" ... "Yes"

Students will always want to seem like the understand and may be afraid of letting you down. Instead try to probe for understanding, for example

> "Right, we've covered map functions, can you tell me what this part inside the parenthesis are doing?" ... "Yes, it's converting a String into a Number"

**7. Above all else, be kind**

At times it may be frustrating or tiring - it's hard work! Try to remember what it was like when you first learned how to code. Remember that with hard work, they will get there eventually.

### Getting Help

First and foremost - you should remember that you are not alone with your students. If you are struggling to find the time to commit to your students reach out on Slack and in your Weekly Calls to find more people to help. 

If your students are all struggling with a similar concept it's important to share this on Slack, not only does this h

We also have full copies to send you. Please speak to your lesson coordinator.

The most important chapters - for your use - are Chapter 1 and Chapter 4.

### Practical

_Time: ~2 hours_

Technical mentoring is a skill like any other that can be developed through practice and critical, constructive feedback.

As a pair, setup a mentoring session with a group of students. One person should spend twenty minutes working with the students on the challenges that they are facing. The other person should take notes and feedback on the session, After twenty minutes, swap roles and continue with the exercise.

For the mentor, try to keep in mind everything that we've cover in this session. You'll make mistakes but don't worry! It's all in the process.

For the watcher, take notes on if your partner is covering the rules that we spoke about earlier.

After the session, feedback your notes to each other.

### Buddy Work

_Time: 30 minutes_

Next time you speak to your student spend some time working out what motivates them and what they want to get from the course. Try to find out

1. Why are they doing the course?
2. Why do they want to be a programmer?
3. What do they think their biggest challenges are to becoming a programmer?

Answering these questions will make it easier for you to tailor your mentoring to your students
