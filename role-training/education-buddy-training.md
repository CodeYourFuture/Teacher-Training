Time: ~2 hours

Mentoring is a skill like any other that can be developed through practice and critical, constructive feedback.

As a pair, setup a mentoring session with a group of students. One person should spend twenty minutes working with the students on the challenges that they are facing. The other person should take notes and feedback on the session, After twenty minutes, swap roles and continue with the exercise.

For the mentor, try to keep in mind everything that we've cover in this session. You'll make mistakes but don't worry! It's all in the process.

For the note taker, try to keep notes on the following areas

* Did the mentor give the students time to think?
* Did the mentor try to enable to the students to find the answer by themselves

After the session, feedback your notes to each other.

#### Buddy Work

Time: 30 minutes

Next time you speak to your student spend some time working out what motivates them and what they want to get from the course. Try to find out

1. Why are they doing the course?
2. Why do they want to be a programmer?
3. What do they think their biggest challenges are to becoming a programmer?

Answering these questions will make it easier for you to tailor your mentoring to your students
