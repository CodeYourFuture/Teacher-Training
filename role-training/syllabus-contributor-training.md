# Syllabus Contributor Training

## Aim

The aim of this training is to 

* Give people some knowledge of designing lessons for the curriculum
* Outline the responsibilities of a Contributor Team

## Prior Knowledge

To find this training useful a participant should

* Understand how CodeYourFuture works mechanically 
  * i.e. What do we teach? Who are our students?
* Have some experience of being in a class at CodeYourFuture
  * Some lead teaching experience is nice to have but not critical

## Pre-lesson Coursework

To prepare for the lesson please read [this section](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html) of the Teaching Tech Together handbook.

**Before the lesson:** Prepare a three minute presentation \(you don't have to use slides, talking points are good enough\) about something that you learnt from reading this material.

## Lesson

### Learning Objectives Exercise

#### Classify Learning Objectives \(pairs/10 minutes\) <a id="classify-learning-objectives-pairs10"></a>

Look at the example learning objectives for an introductory course on HTML and CSS below and classify each according to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Compare your answers with those of your partner. Where did you agree and disagree?

```text
Explain what CSS properties are and how CSS selectors work.

Style a web page using common tags and CSS properties.

Compare and contrast writing HTML and CSS to writing with desktop publishing tools.

Identify and correct issues in sample web pages that would make them difficult for the visually impaired to interact with.

Describe features of favorite web sites whose design particularly appeals to you and explain why.

Describe your two favorite online sources of information about CSS and explain what you like about them.
```

### PETE Exercise

#### \(individual/15 minutes\) <a id="pete-individual15"></a>

One pattern that works well for programming lessons is PETE: introduce the **P**roblem, work through an **E**xample, explain the **T**heory, and then **E**laborate on a second example so that learners can see what is specific to each case and what applies to all cases. 

Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a short lesson for it that follows these five steps.

Then discuss with the team on what you've created.

### PRIMM Exercise

**\(individual/15 minutes\)**

Another lesson pattern is PRIMM - **P**redict a program’s behavior or output, **R**un it to see what it actually does, **I**nvestigate why it does that by stepping through it in a debugger or drawing the flow of control, **M**odify it \(or its inputs\), and then **M**ake something similar from scratch. 

Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a short lesson for it that follows these five steps.

Then discuss with the team on what you've created.
