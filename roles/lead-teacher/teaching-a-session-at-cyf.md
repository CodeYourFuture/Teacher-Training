# Teaching a Session at CYF

## Key Points

* **No lectures** - Nobody talks for more than 10 minutes
* **Don't teach alone** - Share the session teaching amongst volunteers
* **Cold call** - Choose people by name to answer questions (and mix it up!)
* **Live code** - Share your screen and try things out
* **Everybody writes** - Have the trainees code along with you - or have them tell you what to do next
* **Normalise googling** - Say 'I don't know; let's find out' often - even if you do know
* **Exercises over lectures** - Give people plenty of practice coding in public
* **Make mistakes** - And fix them in public
