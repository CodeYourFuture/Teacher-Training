# Assistant Teacher

The assistant teacher’s role is the role of the mentor. You are tasked with working closely with small groups or individual students to guide them through the lessons content. You should motivate when the student is feeling down, explain when the student is not comprehending and encourage the student to be inquisitive. You will be working more closely with our students than anyone else in the organisation and so you are a crucial part of the relationship we have with them.

        <p>In our classrooms we often have a wide range of ability and so it is essential
          that we mentor the students who are struggling so they don&#x2019;t fall
          behind.</p>
        <p>Take the time not only to teach but also to motivate and connect with
          the student. Many of our students may never have met a programmer before
          and this can be a great opportunity for them to ask questions about your
          background and day to day life.</p>

        <p>When interacting with students, try to gauge how they are doing in the
          lesson. Spot students who are doing well and those that are doing poorly.
          It is important you feed this back to our coordinators at the end of the
          day.</p>
        <p>Giving feedback and assessing homework from the students is also an important
          job for you as a teaching assistant.</p>

        <p>As a teaching assistant you are uniquely placed to give active feedback
          to your lead teacher. Never be afraid to ask the teacher to explain again
          if you think the students don&#x2019;t understand a topic or to offer extra
          clarification. Wherever possible, feedback to the teacher on how the students
          you&#x2019;re interacting with are doing.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we encourage feedback on the lesson itself. We try to foster
          a community of growth and education for everyone at CodeYourFuture - not
          just our students.</p>

</table>### Classroom Rules

1. ​Follow the Code of Conduct
   * You should report any violations to the Personal Development team
2. Don't touch the keyboard.
   * Unless you're 100% certain that whatever your doing is outside of the students required understanding
3. Be empathetic. 
   * Our students come from many different cultures, have many different levels of English, have different levels of computer literacy, have many different employment statuses
4. Don't demotivate. 
   * It can be easy to demotivate students using dismissive language \(e.g. "it’s easy, just do this"\)
5. Be patient.
   * Everything takes time and they will get there in the end
6. Remember you are an expert.
   * Be aware of your blind spots when working with beginners

### Tips

_Don’t touch the keyboard_

Wherever possible direct the student to actually type the solution on their laptop rather than taking control. When you take a students laptop it disempowers and demotivates them and makes them less likely to experiment with solutions.

_Ask don’t tell_

As an assistant teacher, your job is not to understand **what** the student doesn’t understand but **why** they don’t understand it. You are in the lucky position of working closely with the students and so are uniquely placed to fix core misunderstandings in their mental models. The most important question in your arsenal is “_What do you think the answer is?_”.

_Homework in mind_

When mentoring a student you should always have the homework for the week in mind. You should be helping them to understand concepts well enough so that you can confidently say that they will be able to complete the homework to a sufficient level. If you don’t know the homework for the week, ask your Lead Teacher.
