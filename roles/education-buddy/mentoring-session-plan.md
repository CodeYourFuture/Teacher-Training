# Mentoring Session Plan

## Brief

Below you will find an example session plan that you can use to structure the time with your students. 

You are encouraged to add, remove and change this plan as you see fit - this plan should give you a basis to work from.

## Mentoring Session

### Welcome & Chit Chat \(10 minutes\)

Open the session with some chat about their lives and what they've been doing recently. One of the most critical parts of the mentoring scheme is the relationships that our built over the course and the trust that is developed from that.

You should always begin with talking about them but don't be afraid to talk about yourself - they're always interested in what you do as well!

### Goal Catch-Up \(5 minutes\)

Make sure you hold your students accountable to completing the goals that you set for them - it's important that you show that they are important.

### Recap & Orientation \(10 minutes\)

It's important to orient yourself to what the student has been working recently so that you can help them. You'll want to answer the following questions

1. What did they do in the last lesson?
2. What was the homework for the last lesson?
3. What did they not understand from the last lesson?

### Technical Mentoring \(30+ minutes\)

For the areas that the student did not understand try to pick apart what _exactly_ they did not grasp. 

The recommended approach is to use [_Extend & Explain_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b23cdD2u2difmxSpEulD_KdBUfOiqCNB8TwAs23bHgM/edit#slide=id.g981ead9fdd_1_17) __but you are welcome to use any method you like. 

Take care to take notes on what exactly the don't understand. Remember [PEA](education-buddy-training.md#feeding-back-to-the-team)!

### Goal Setting \(10+ minutes\)

To get the most of your students you must set goals for them to achieve by the the next time you speak. Goals are important to a students development as they keep pushing them towards growth in a personalised way.

Wherever possible - remember to keep your goals [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm). The goals you set should most importantly be achievable by the students in the time that they have available.

### Wrap Up \(5 minutes\)

For anything that you didn't get to in your mentoring session direct them towards resources to help them. For example

* Tell them - not ask them - to share their problems in their Slack channel
* Direct them towards online materials to help them
* Tell them to go to a study group or to partake in peer learning when you're unavailable
* And finally - schedule follow up calls 

Spend your final few moments encouraging them and how well they've done on the session - try to find specific moments that they made progress over the past week.
