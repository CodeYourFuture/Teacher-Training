# Marking Coursework

## Overview

Every week, our students complete coursework which aims to 

* Put what they've learnt into practice
* Stretch their abilities 
* Display progress in their learning

Each week's coursework consists of 

* Reading 
* Watching videos, either
  * Explainers
  * Introductions, or
  * Code Alongs
* Coding Exercises

and

* Coding Challenges

At the end of each week, students submit homework these challenges and we assess and give feedback on them. **This feedback is a vital part of our students development.**
